=head1 NAME

IPC::ConcurrencyLimit::Lock::Redis - Locking via Redis

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # see also: IPC::ConcurrencyLimit::Lock
  
  use IPC::ConcurrencyLimit;
  use Redis;
  
  my $redis = Redis->new(server => ...);
  my $limit = IPC::ConcurrencyLimit->new(
    type       => 'Redis',
    max_procs  => 1, # defaults to 1
    redis_conn => $redis,
    key_name   => "mylock",
    # optional value to store. Will be prefixed with UUID (see below)
    # proc_info  => "...",
  );
  
  my $id = $limit->get_lock;
  if (not $id) {
    warn "Couldn't get lock";
    exit();
  }
  
  # do work

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module requires a Redis server that supports Lua
scripting.

This locking strategy uses L<Redis> to implement an
C<IPC::ConcurrencyLimit> lock type. This particular
Redis-based lock implementation uses a single Redis
hash (a hash in a single Redis key) as storage for
tracking the locks.

=head2 Lock Implementation on the Server

The structure of the lock on the server is not considered an
implementation detail, but part of the public interface.
So long it is inspected and modified atomically, you can
choose to modify it through different channels than the API of
this class.

This is important because the lock is released in the
lock object's destructor, so if a perl process segfaults
or on network failure between the process and Redis
then the lock cannot be released! More on that below.

Given a lock C<"mylock"> with a C<max_procs> setting
of 5 (default: 1) and three out of five lock instances taken,
the lock structure in Redis would look as follows:

  "mylock": {
                "1": "BINARYUUID1-some info",
                "2": "BINARYUUID2-some other",
                "3": "BINARYUUID3-yet other info"
            }

where BINARYUUIDX is understood to be a 128bit/16byte binary UUID
whose first 60bits are a microsecond-precision timestamp in binary,
from high to low significance bits. See "version 4s" UUIDs
as described in L<Data::UUID::MT>.

If subsequently lock number 2 is released, the structure
becomes:

  "mylock": {
                "1": "BINARYUUID1-some info",
                "3": "BINARYUUID3-yet other info"
            }

The next lock to be obtained would again use entry number 2.
When creating a lock object, you may pass a C<proc_info>
parameter. This parameter (string) will be used as the value
of the corresponding hash entry after prepending the lock's UUID
(So C<proc_info> would be C<"some info">, etc. above).
By default, C<proc_info> is the empty string.

The combination of the time-ordered UUID and custom C<proc_info>
properties may be used to evict stale locks
before attempting to obtain a new lock. The default behaviour of
using the current time as part of the UUID allows for expiring
old locks if that is good enough for your application.
Using PIDs in C<proc_info> could be used to clean out stale
locks referring to the same client host, etc.

Most importantly, however, the UUID is (with on certainty bordering
probability) unique so that you can use to clearly indicate whether
you lost the lock if it changes from under you (cf. C<heartbeat>).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Given a hash ref with options, attempts to obtain a lock in
the pool. On success, returns the lock object, otherwise undef.

Required named parameters:

=over 2

=item C<max_procs>

The maximum no. of locks (and thus usually processes)
to allow at one time.

=item C<redis_conn>

A Redis connection object. See L<Redis>.

=item C<key_name>

Indicates the Redis key to use for storing the lock hash.

=back

Options:

=over 2

=item C<proc_info>

If provided, this string will be stored in the value slot for
the lock obtained together with a UUID (see above).
Defaults to the empty string.

=back

=head2 heartbeat

This C<IPC::ConcurrencyLimit::Lock> subclass implements a
heartbeat method that check whether the UUID and C<proc_info>
on the server is still the same as the UUID and C<proc_info>
properties of the object.

Whenever called (successfully), updates the time portion of the
UUID to the current time in both client and server.

=head2 clear_old_locks

Class method!

Given a Redis connection object, a key name for the lock,
and a cutoff time stamp (in seconds, potentially fractional),
removes all locks in the given key that are older than the
provided cutoff time stamp.

This is only going to work on 64bit perls right now, sorry.
Patches welcome.

Since heartbeat() updates the UUID timestamp, the cutoff refers
to the most recent heartbeat, not to the original lock creation
time. But that is what you usually want anyway.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<IPC::ConcurrencyLimit> and the abstract lock base class
L<IPC::ConcurrencyLimit::Lock>.

L<Redis>, the Perl-Redis interface used by this module.

L<Redis::ScriptCache>, which makes Lua-scripting with Redis a bit
less work.

L<Data::UUID::MT>, whose "version 4s" UUIDs are used here.
